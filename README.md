Customise admin to make it more user friendly

list_filter: Adding filters for category and is_active allows you to quickly narrow down products by their category or active status.
search_fields: Adding search_fields for name and sku enables quick searches, making it easier to locate specific products.
ordering: Keeping the ordering by SKU or any other relevant field provides consistency in the display order.

Discount price 

    Conditionally Displayed Prices:
        If product.discount_price exists, the original product.price is displayed with a strikethrough (text-decoration: line-through;) and muted color.
        The discounted price (product.discount_price) is highlighted in a bold, different color (e.g., text-danger for red in Bootstrap).
    Fallback:
        If thereâ€™s no discount_price, only product.price is displayed normally.

Q

f request.GET:
        if 'q' in request.GET:
            query = request.GET['q']
            if not query:
                messages.error(request, "You didn't enter any search criteria!")
                return redirect(reverse('products'))
            
            queries = Q(name__icontains=query) | Q(description__icontains=query)
            products = products.filter(queries)

    context = {
        'products': products,
        'search_term': query,
    }
